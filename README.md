ðŸŒŸ Game Introduction
Alien Siege: Fight Against Threats from the Sky!

Aliens are besieging the Earth, and the sky is filled with unknown enemies! "Alien Siege" is an adrenaline-pumping shooting game that invites you to this epic battle.
With its simple controls and immersive gameplay, we offer a unique experience that players of all ages will enjoy.

So, what does "Alien Siege" offer you?

Simple and Addictive Gameplay: Your goal in "Alien Siege" is crystal clear: target and destroy the randomly appearing alien spaceships (UFOs) on your screen!
All you need to do is aim at the right time with your quick reflexes. Earn points with every successful hit and reach the targets needed to advance through levels. Easy to play, challenging to master!

Evolving Difficulty Levels: As you progress, the alien threat intensifies! UFOs will move faster, perform trickier maneuvers, and demand even greater aiming skills from you.

Random Birds, Strategic Targets: Innocent birds also fly through your game area.
Shooting them will distract you from your target and can cause you to lose health. This adds a strategic depth: Be quick, but choose your targets wisely!

Adrenaline-Pumping Sound Effects: Immerse yourself in the heart of the battle with satisfying sound effects accompanying every shot, every explosion, and every successful hit.

User-Friendly Interface: Our game's interface is designed to plunge you directly into the action.
